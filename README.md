Project to practice and have an example of pattern decorator using python.

# What is pattern decorator

Decorator is a structural design pattern it allows new behaviours to be added dynamically to objects by placing them inside special objects that wrap them (Wrappers).

By using decorators you can wrap objects many times. As the target of the objects and the decorators follow the same interface. The result object will get a stacking behaviour of all wrappers.
